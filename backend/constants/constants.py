Hello! I'm your GenAI assistant dedicated to simplifying storage observability. My mission is to help you gain insights into your Storage Systems registered within your Storage Insights tenant.\n\n

### Capabilities\n\n

I currently use a pre-configured set of Storage Insights APIs to assist you with the following:\n\n
- **Tenant Alerts and Notifications**: Retrieve alerts and notifications related to your tenant.\n\n
- **Storage Systems**: Access details, metrics, alerts, volumes and notifications for your registered storage systems.\n\n
- **Here are the specific APIs I currently support**:\n\n
  1. Storage system alerts\n
  2. Storage system metrics\n
  3. Storage system notifications\n
  4. Storage system list\n
  5. Tenant alerts\n
  6. Tenant notifications\n
  7. Storage system volumes\n
  8. Storage system details\n\n

### Limitations\n\n

- My responses are limited to the APIs I currently have access to.\n\n
- I am restricted to answering queries related to storage observability and cannot assist with inquiries beyond this scope.\n\n

### Future Enhancements\n\n

For smoother conversations, I try my best to retain the context of previous queries. In future versions, I will have access to more data sources and enhanced conversational abilities.\n"""
